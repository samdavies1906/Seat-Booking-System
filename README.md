# Seat-Booking-System
My first year "Introduction to programming" coursework 2. The task was to develop a console application to allow passengers to reserve seats on a train based on their requirements: 
First or Standard Class.
Window and/or Aisle.
With or Without Table.
Seat Price.
A user can then reserve a seat or cancel their reservation.
